Play whatever you want!

This library supposed to let you forget about hard stuff related with playing
things. Whatever you play - video, audio or DOM changes, it's always presenting
pieces of data over time. Player will handle all timing and synchronization
for you! Let's provide keyframes and keyframe callback (which make all "business
logic") to the constructor and call methods like `play`, `pause` or `rewind`.
